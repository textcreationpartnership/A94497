            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the chiefeſt and moſt glorious Attribute of power, being Mercy, the ſafeſt addreſſe thereto muſt be Submiſſion, which makes us in all humility offer unto the conſideration of this Honourable Aſſembly, the great and heavy burthen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which wee grone, and though to Lawes we humbly ſhall ſubmit, yet ſuch is the weight of ſome that lye upon us, that nothing leſſe then linity can let us live, nor can wee any way find out reliefe, but by applying our ſelves unto this High Court, whereas Fathers and ſupreame Judges, you reſide, retaining ſtill full power to frame, or change, according to the exigency of times, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and being prudent and mercifull, can affoord us patience, and favour in this ſhort Petition, wherein wee ſhall yeeld our ſelves fit Subjects for your mercy, or obedient Submittees to your wills and reſolutions.</p>
            <p>The many penall Lawes in force againſt your humbleſt Petitioners are to this Honourable Aſſembly knowne, as is the ground on which they firſt were made not out of memory, having had their birth but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when partly extraordinary proceedings from the See of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt her perſon, and partly the claime our dread Soveraignes Grandmother (wholly devoted to that Religion) layd to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſucceſſion of the Crowne, occaſioned ſeverall diſtractions, and even caſt jealouſies and ſuſpitions upon all, that in Religion had relation to that See, whereupon from emergent reaſon of State, and by way of prudent cautions, and prevanting future diſobedience (and not to put reſtraint upon the conſcience of the Subject or to puniſh contrariety of opinion or beliefe) theſe lawes as we conceive were made, and afterward much aggravated and made more heavy to us all, by occaſion of that ever moſt dereſtable plot, of thoſe few decayed turbulent and deſperatly diſcontented perſons, indeed profeſſors of the ſame Religion, but quite neglecting and tranſgreſſing, and moſt inhumanly therein forgetting all duty and obligation.</p>
            <p>If thus (Right noble Gentlemen) theſe Lawes originally vvere appropriated to theſe times, and no ſuch reaſon now (we hope) appeares, and ſtill theſe Lawes overwhelmes us. It is either for the perſonall offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of other men, whoſe wicked facts, we (are no waies guilty of) with all good Chriſtians utterly abhorre, or for ſuppoſed errours of our underſtanding and beliefe, which as in it ſelfe (according to all Divines) is an effect immediate of grace, and therefore not to be enforced: So in its tenets, there is not any thing forbids, invites, or hinders the profeſſors of it, from their due obedience to their Prince, and faithfull preſervation of their Countries liberties. In proſecution of vvhich truth, we heere abjure as falſe, and moſt erroneous, both aſſaſination of Princes, and faith is not to be kept with all ſorts of people, and doe deteſt them both, as moſt oppugnant to humanity, and not to be allowed by any Religion whatſoever; We alſo ſhall, and will be ever ready to maintaine and defend with all our powers, lives, and fortunes, all our Countries liberties, the Rights, and Priviledges of the Parliaments, the Subjects lawfull Rights, liberty and propriety, the peace and unity of his Majeſties three Kingdomes of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in all juſt and honourable wayes, endeavour the puniſhment of all that ſeeke or worke the contrary; as dutifull obedient and loyall Subjects are obliged, and as true borne Lovers of their Countries good are bound; All which (under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) as the Lavves now ſtand we no wayes are permitted, as having neither freedome, nor fortunes of our ovvne, for ſtrictly are our actions, Judgements, and our tongues tyed up.</p>
            <p>But the approaching ſtorme that ſeemes to threaten here, moves us to take ſhelter under your mercies vvings, moſt freely ſpread to comfort all agrieved, vvhere vve doe hope for ſhadovv and protection. And humbly are Petitioners, that you vvill be pleaſed to eaſe our ſufferings, by mitigating the Rigor of thoſe penall Lavves, that either ruine us, and our poſterity, or caſt a thraldome on our conſciences, ſo as vve meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vvalking in our fore-Fathers ſteps, aſpiring unto nothing but poſſeſſing our ſelves in peace, as people that ſeeke eaſe not honours, and that the crime of <hi>Catholiques</hi> before this Honourable Aſſembly <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
